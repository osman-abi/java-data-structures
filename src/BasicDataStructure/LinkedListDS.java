     * LinkedList is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element
     * is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses.
     * Each element is known as a node. Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred
     * over the arrays. It also has few disadvantages like the nodes cannot be accessed directly instead we need to start
     * from the head and follow through the link to reach to a node we wish to access.
